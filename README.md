                                        MARIJUANA STRAIN GENERATOR



WHAT AM I?

    Hello and welcome to the Marijuana Strain Generator. As majority of us know, the legalization of Marijuana is spreading like wildfire, literally. With that growth also comes the increase of strains as farmers look to leave their own impact in the field. If you're new to the world of Marijuana and indulging in all it has to offer, or even if you're a seasoned vet, this app can open your eyes to new strains. 
    
    With an API from http://strains.evanbusse.com/, providing almost 2,000 different strains, there are sure to be a few you may have overlooked.This program is designed to pull consumers away from their usual strains and help them expand their collection. They can search simply by Race or even by a specific feeling they may be in need of and the program will randomly generate a strain matching their needs.
